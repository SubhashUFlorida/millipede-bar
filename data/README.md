This folder includes CSV files with the incident waveform data, including the following four types of pulses:
- Triangular
- Gaussian

Three pulse lengths are available for each type, corresponding to T* = 25, 5, and 1 for the parameters provided in the `parameters.toml` file.

An experimentally obtained signal is also provided.
